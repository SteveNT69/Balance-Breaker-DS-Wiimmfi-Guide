# Balance Breaker Wiimmfi Guide
A guide on how to connect to Wiimmfi, a replacement server for the now-defunct Nintendo WFC for the Nintendo DS and Wii. This lets you play Nintendo DS and Wii games online once again.

## Nintendo DS and 3DS/2DS family
1. Find the Nintendo WFC setup in any Nintendo WFC enabled DS game, or if you're on a 3DS/2DS family console you can access the Nintendo WFC setup via the System Settings app.
1. Setup an Internet connection. Note: This will only work with networks that have WEP security or no security. If you're not sure what security your network has, it's most likely WPA/WPA2 unless your router is ancient. In that case, you can either setup an open guest network or an easier way is to setup an open mobile hotspot for your console to connect to. *Most* mobile hotspots should work.
1. Set `Auto-obtain DNS` to `No`.
1. Set `Primary DNS` to `164.132.44.106`.
1. Click `Test Connection`. If you followed the instructions correctly it should say `Connection successful`. Now you can connect to Wiimmfi!
